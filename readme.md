Thanks to the awesome tutorial from [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAV69dS1uWTaoxyeBbKpAEF90i4ijUQZ), this is a starter code to explore mongodb with nodejs and mocha.

There are few deviation from the tutorial and it is done so to work with different schema. The profile.js is self explanatory.

to run test:
```
npm run test
```
